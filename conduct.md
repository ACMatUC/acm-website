TL;DR. ACM@UC is dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone.

# Code of Conduct
In addition to the University of Cincinnati’s Student Code of Conduct, ACM@UC has it’s own code of conduct.

ACM@UC is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or computing experience or lack thereof. We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the organization executives.
