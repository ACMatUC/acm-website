    I’m a 3rd year computer science major at UC with a particular fascination with mobile apps. I am an iOS developer, UI designer, and UX consultant. I am very involved on campus with both ACM and RevolutionUC, and couldn’t ask for a better club to completely consume my time. Have any app ideas? Message me on Slack ;).
