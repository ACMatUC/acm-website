I have a passion for making awesome tech products, and my combination of business and technological experience gives me a unique perspective on how to make lives better with technology. I have had the incredible opportunity to work at The Kroger Company over the past two years, where I began as a Software Developer and have since moved into Product Management. I am an avid gym goer, and I love to watch both football and soccer games when I can!
